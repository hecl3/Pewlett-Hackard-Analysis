# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:

For this analysis I was asked to determine the number of employees born from 1952-55 that are still current employees of Pewlett-Hackard, and will be retiring in the next few years. I was also asked to determine their titles at retirement. Lastly, I compiled a list of employees born in the year 1965 who would be eligible for mentorship and could be promoted up into the newly vacated roles.

Deliverable 1:
•	There are exactly 90398 unique employees that will be retiring soon from PH
•	Of those, 57668 have “Senior” in their job description. 29414 are Senior Engineers, 28254 are Senior Staff
• In addition, 14222 Engineers, 12243 Staff, 4502 Technique Leaders, 1761 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers will also be retiring

Deliverable 2:
•	There were 1549 employees born in 1965 and eligible for the Mentorship program

Summary:

In short, there is just over 90K employees that will be retiring soon, and only 1.5K currently with the company that could replace them. Of those, further research could be done into what job titles they currently have, and the list should be expanded to include those in the surrounding years, i.e., 1964-1966, and more. As it is, there's not nearly enough current employees in the mentorship program to replace a fraction of those up for retirement. Solutions include selecting more current employees for the mentorship program and/or hiring a great deal more people to replace those leaving.
